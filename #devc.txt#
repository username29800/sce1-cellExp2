<purpose>
1. create a cell-resembling application structure
2. divide each feature by functions or files
3. implement decentralized, parallel, and role-specific 'immune cell applications'

<process>
1. implement core data and code preservation (by archiving, compressing, encoding, and cryprography)
2. implement self-remedial functions depending on 1
3. decentralized, procedural, role-unified immune cell
4. decentralized, procedural, role-specific immune cell
5. decentralized, parallel, role-specific immune cell

<structure and contents>
1. flag - self-status indicator
2. allowlist - filename-based whitelist
3. blocklist - filename-based blacklist
4. fraglist - file content (binary) based blacklist
