<purpose>
1. create a cell-resembling application structure
2. divide each feature by functions or files
3. implement decentralized, parallel, and role-specific 'immune cell applications'

<process>
1. implement core data and code preservation (by archiving, compressing, encoding, and cryprography)
2. implement self-remedial functions depending on 1
3. decentralized, procedural, role-unified immune cell (optional)
4. decentralized, procedural, role-specific immune cell (optional)
5. decentralized, parallel, role-specific immune cell

<structure and contents>
1. flag (variable, plain text) - self-status indicator
2. allowlist (plain text) - allowed file list, automatically generated at cell initialization
3. blocklist (plain text) - files that activate self-destruction when found
4. origin (zip archive) - core module storage, encoded, archived, compressed
5. utils (python with def expr) - popular core functions such as flag and allowlist
6. action (python with def expr) - functions for every module
7. main (python, server-like structure) -
